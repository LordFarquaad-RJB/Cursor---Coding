 * DETAILED FX PROCESSING, LOOPING, AND SYNCHRONIZATION EXPLANATION
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Understanding how !spawnComplexFx processes commands and manages FX loops,
 * especially the SYNC vs. DESYNC modes, is crucial for complex effects.
 *
 * I. COMMAND PARSING & INITIAL SETUP (`TokenFX.fx.spawnComplexFx`):
 *
 *  1. Parameter Extraction:
 *     The command `!spawnComplexFx FX[...] CLR[...] ID[...] TD[...] TR[...] TI[...] TARGET[...] GR[...] GD[...] SYNC[...]`
 *     is parsed into key-value pairs.
 *     - FX: The base name of the effect (e.g., "beam", "myCustomMissile").
 *     - CLR: Color for standard FX (e.g., "fire"). Ignored for custom FX.
 *     - ID: Token ID(s) for the source of the FX. Can be multiple.
 *     - TD: Token Delay (seconds) before this specific token starts its FX sequence.
 *           Defaults to 0. Applied individually per token.
 *     - TR: Token Repeats for this specific token. How many times its FX will spawn.
 *           Can be a number or "infinite". Defaults to 1.
 *           Example: TR[infinite] means this token's FX will repeat forever.
 *     - TI: Token Interval (seconds) between each repeat for this specific token.
 *           Can be a number or "auto". "auto" tries to estimate based on the FX's
 *           visual duration. Defaults to `config.defaultTokenInterval`.
 *           Example: TI[0.4] means this token waits 0.4s between its own repeats.
 *     - TARGET: Token ID(s) for the target of the FX. Used by FX types listed
 *               in `config.FX_TYPES_REQUIRING_TARGET` (e.g., "beam").
 *     - GR: Global Repeats. How many times the entire sequence (all specified
 *           tokens and their individual repeats) will run. Defaults to 1.
 *           Example: GR[infinite] means the entire sequence of all tokens will repeat forever.
 *     - GD: Global Delay (seconds). The delay *between* each Global Repeat cycle.
 *           Defaults to 0.
 *           Example: GD[0.4] means after all tokens finish, wait 0.4s before starting the whole sequence again.
 *     - SYNC: Synchronization mode ("sync" or "desync"). Defaults to "desync".
 *             This is a critical parameter determining timing.
 * 
 *  2. Key Differences Between TR/TI and GR/GD:
 *     - TR/TI control individual token behavior:
 *       Example: !spawnComplexFx FX[beam] ID[A] ID[B] TR[infinite] TI[0.4]
 *       → Both tokens A and B will continuously spawn beams every 0.4s
 *     - GR/GD control the entire sequence:
 *       Example: !spawnComplexFx FX[beam] ID[A] ID[B] GR[infinite] GD[0.4]
 *       → After both A and B finish their beams, wait 0.4s before starting again
 *     - Using both:
 *       Example: !spawnComplexFx FX[beam] ID[A] ID[B] TR[2] TI[0.4] GR[infinite] GD[1]
 *       → Each token spawns 2 beams (0.4s apart), then waits 1s before the whole sequence repeats
 *
 *  3. Targeting System:
 *     - Standard FX Targeting:
 *       • Some standard FX (like "beam") require targets
 *       • Use TARGET[tokenID] to specify where the FX should go
 *       • Multiple targets can be specified: TARGET[A] TARGET[B]
 *       • Example: !spawnComplexFx FX[beam] CLR[fire] ID[source] TARGET[destination]
 *
 *     - Custom FX Targeting:
 *       • Custom FX can be designed to work with or without targets
 *       • If a custom FX requires targets, it must be listed in config.FX_TYPES_REQUIRING_TARGET
 *       • Example: !spawnComplexFx FX[myCustomMissile] ID[source] TARGET[destination]
 *
 *     - Pairing Mode (New!):
 *       • When ID and TARGET counts match, enters pairing mode
 *       • Each ID is paired with its corresponding TARGET
 *       • Global settings (TR, TI, TD) apply to all pairs unless overridden
 *       • Example: !spawnComplexFx FX[beam] CLR[fire] ID[A] TARGET[X] ID[B] TARGET[Y] TR[infinite] TI[0.4]
 *         → A→X and B→Y beams, both continuous with 0.4s interval
 *
 *  4. Recent Updates:
 *     - Added Pairing Mode for easier multi-token targeting
 *     - Global settings (TR, TI, TD) now work in pairing mode
 *     - Improved targeting validation and error messages
 *     - Added support for "auto" interval timing based on FX duration
 *     - Enhanced documentation and examples
 *
 *  5. Best Practices:
 *     - Use pairing mode for multiple source-target pairs
 *     - Use TR/TI for continuous effects (like beams)
 *     - Use GR/GD for pulsing effects (like explosions)
 *     - Always specify TARGET for FX types that require it
 *     - Use SYNC[sync] when you want all tokens to start together
 *     - Use SYNC[desync] when you want independent timing
 * 
 * - [IMPORTANT] **When using !spawnComplexFx (in chat or macros), you must use one ID per ID[...] argument. Do NOT put multiple IDs in a single ID[...] with spaces.**
 * - Example (correct): !spawnComplexFx FX[smoke] ID[-ID1] ID[-ID2] TR[1] TI[1]
 * - Example (incorrect): !spawnComplexFx FX[smoke] ID[-ID1 -ID2] TR[1] TI[1]  ← This will NOT work in Roll20 chat or macros, as Roll20 splits on spaces before the script sees the command.
 *
 *  6. FX Identification:
 *     - If FX[...] matches a name in `TokenFX.config.customFxDefinitions`, it's treated
 *       as a custom FX, and its ID is used.
 *     - Otherwise, it's treated as a standard FX, combined with CLR[...] (e.g., "beam-fire").
 *
 *  7. Loop Data Structure (`loopData`):
 *     A unique `loopID` is generated. All data for this specific command invocation
 *     is stored in `TokenFX.state.activeFxLoops[loopID]`. This `loopData` includes:
 *     - `fxType`: The actual FX string/ID to spawn (e.g., "beam-fire", "-MyCustomFxID").
 *     - `fxDisplayName`: User-friendly name for logging.
 *     - `isCustom`: Boolean.
 *     - `tokens`: An object where each key is a source `ID` from the command.
 *                 Its value is an object: `{ TDelay, TRrepeats, TInterval, internalTimeouts:[], currentRepeat:0 }`.
 *     - `targets`: An object similar to `tokens` for `TARGET` IDs (though TD, TR, TI aren't typically varied for targets in the current design).
 *     - `globalTimeouts`: Array to hold `setTimeout` handles for managing GR and GD.
 *     - `globalCounter`: Tracks current global repeat.
 *     - `globalDelay`, `globalRepeats`, `syncMode`: Copied from parsed parameters.
 *
 *  8. Token-Specific Parameter Processing:
 *     For each source `ID[...]`:
 *     - TD, TR, TI are assigned.
 *     - If TI is "auto", the script estimates the FX's visual duration:
 *       - For custom FX: from `config.customFxDurationOverrides` (if ID matches) or by
 *         parsing the FX definition's `duration` and `lifeSpan` against `config.assumedFxSystemFPS`.
 *       - For standard FX: from `config.standardFxVisualDurations` (if type matches).
 *       - If no duration found, `config.defaultTokenInterval` is used.
 *     - Warnings for potential TI/duration overlap are issued.
 *     - FXs with infinite emitters (e.g., custom FX definition duration -1) or those in
 *       `config.disallowedLoopingFx` will have their TR (Token Repeats) forced to 1,
 *       as script-based looping is redundant or disallowed.
 *
 *  9. Dispatching the Loop:
 *     Based on `syncMode`, either `TokenFX.fx.applyFxLoop_sync(loopID)` or
 *     `TokenFX.fx.applyFxLoop_desync(loopID)` is called to start the FX.
 *
 *
 * II. DESYNCHRONIZED MODE (`SYNC[desync]` or default):
 *     (`TokenFX.fx.applyFxLoop_desync`)
 *
 *  - Philosophy: "Fire and forget" for each token's full sequence, then repeat globally.
 *  - Global Cycle: The `applyFxLoop_desync` function is called initially and then re-scheduled
 *    by `setTimeout` using `loopData.globalDelay` until `loopData.globalCounter`
 *    reaches `loopData.globalRepeats`.
 *
 *  - Token Behavior within a Global Cycle:
 *    - For *each* token ID specified in the command:
 *      - A `setTimeout` is scheduled using its individual `tokenData.TDelay`.
 *      - When this initial delay expires, the FX is spawned for that token.
 *      - `tokenData.currentRepeat` is incremented.
 *      - If `tokenData.TRrepeats` is not met (or is "infinite"), another `setTimeout`
 *        is scheduled for this *same token* using `tokenData.TInterval` to spawn its next FX.
 *      - This continues until the token has completed all its `TRrepeats`.
 *
 *  - Key Characteristics:
 *    - Each token runs its full set of delays and repeats independently of other tokens
 *      defined in the same command.
 *    - The `loopData.globalDelay` only takes effect *after* all tokens have been
 *      *scheduled* for their first set of operations in the current global cycle. It does
 *      not wait for them to complete their individual `TRrepeats` sequences.
 *
 *  - Example: `!spawnComplexFx FX[burn] ID[A] TD[0] TR[2] TI[1] ID[B] TD[3] TR[1] TI[1] GR[1] GD[0] SYNC[desync]`
 *    - Token A: Spawns FX at 0s. Spawns FX again at 1s. (Completes its 2 repeats)
 *    - Token B: Spawns FX at 3s. (Completes its 1 repeat)
 *    - There's no waiting for A to finish before B starts its delay, or vice-versa.
 *    - If GR was 2 and GD was 5s: After A & B are *initially scheduled*, the script waits 5s,
 *      then re-schedules A (to start at 5s from global cycle start) and B (to start at 8s from global cycle start).
 *
 *
 * III. SYNCHRONIZED MODE (`SYNC[sync]`):
 *      (`TokenFX.fx.applyFxLoop_sync`)
 *
 *  - Philosophy: Attempt to make global cycles more coordinated, especially when `GD[0]`.
 *    The script waits for all tokens to complete their *entire individual sequence*
 *    (all their TRrepeats) within the current global cycle before starting the GD countdown
 *    for the *next* global cycle.
 *
 *  - Global Cycle & Token Behavior:
 *    1. The `applyFxLoop_sync` function is called.
 *    2. For *each* token ID:
 *       - An initial `setTimeout` is scheduled using its `tokenData.TDelay`.
 *       - When this delay expires, its first FX is spawned.
 *       - It then continues its own `TRrepeats` using its `TInterval`, similar to desync.
 *    3. Tracking Completion:
 *       - The script tracks `longestTokenCycleDurationThisGlobalLoop`. This is roughly the
 *         time from the start of the global cycle until the token that takes the longest
 *         (considering its TD, TR, and TI) finishes all its individual repeats.
 *       - It also counts `completedTokenCycles`.
 *    4. Starting Next Global Cycle:
 *       - Once *all* tokens have finished their full `TRrepeats` sequence for the *current* global cycle:
 *         - The `loopData.globalCounter` is incremented.
 *         - If `loopData.globalRepeats` is not met:
 *           - A `nextGlobalSyncDelay` is calculated:
 *             - It's primarily based on the command's `loopData.globalDelay` (GD).
 *             - **Crucial for `GD[0]` (or very small GD):** If GD is 0 (or minimal),
 *               the `nextGlobalSyncDelay` effectively becomes the `longestTokenCycleDurationThisGlobalLoop`.
 *               This ensures that a GD of 0 in sync mode means "start the next global cycle
 *               immediately after everyone in the current cycle is truly finished."
 *             - If GD > 0, the `nextGlobalSyncDelay` is that explicit GD value, and this delay
 *               starts *after* the longest token sequence has finished.
 *           - A `setTimeout` schedules the *next call* to `applyFxLoop_sync` using this
 *             `nextGlobalSyncDelay`.
 *
 *  - Key Characteristics:
 *    - The start of the *next* global cycle (if GR > 1) is generally gated by the completion
 *      of *all* token sequences in the *current* global cycle.
 *    - Useful for creating "waves" of effects where one full wave must complete before the
 *      next wave (and its Global Delay) begins.
 *
 *  - Example 1: `!spawnComplexFx FX[burn] ID[A] TD[0] TR[2] TI[1] ID[B] TD[0.5] TR[1] TI[1] GR[2] GD[0] SYNC[sync]`
 *    - Global Cycle 1:
 *      - Token A: Spawns FX at 0s. Spawns FX again at 1s. (A's sequence takes ~2s)
 *      - Token B: Spawns FX at 0.5s. (B's sequence takes ~1s from its start, or ~1.5s from global start)
 *      - Longest path for this cycle is A, finishing around 2s.
 *      - Since GD is 0, Global Cycle 2 starts immediately after ~2s.
 *    - Global Cycle 2:
 *      - Repeats the above timing, relative to the start of Global Cycle 2.
 *
 *  - Example 2: `!spawnComplexFx FX[burn] ID[A] TD[0] TR[1] TI[1] ID[B] TD[0] TR[1] TI[1] GR[2] GD[5] SYNC[sync]`
 *    - Global Cycle 1:
 *      - Token A: Spawns FX at 0s (takes ~1s total).
 *      - Token B: Spawns FX at 0s (takes ~1s total).
 *      - Both finish around 1s. Longest path is ~1s.
 *      - The script now waits for `GD[5]` seconds.
 *    - Global Cycle 2:
 *      - Starts 5 seconds *after* both A and B finished in Global Cycle 1.
 *      - Token A & B spawn their FX again.
 *
 *
 * IV. STOPPING FX (`!stopFxLoop [LoopID]` and `!stopAllFx`):
 *
 *  - `!stopFxLoop [LoopID]`: Clears all `setTimeout` handles (both global and
 *    individual token internal timeouts) associated with the given `loopID` and
 *    removes the loop data from `TokenFX.state.activeFxLoops`.
 *  - `!stopAllFx`: Iterates through all `loopID`s in `activeFxLoops` and stops each one.
 *
 * This system allows for a range of effects, from simple, single FX spawns to
 * complex, multi-token, repeating, and synchronized/desynchronized waves of effects.
 * Understanding the interplay of TD, TR, TI with GR, GD, and SYNC is key.

/**
 * V. AREA TRIGGERS & CHAIN REACTIONS (`TokenFX.trigger`):
 *    Commands: `!triggerByTag`, `!triggerByTagChain`, `!stopChains`
 *
 *  - Purpose: Allows an FX or other macro to be triggered on tokens within a radius
 *    of a selected token, based on a "tag" in their GM Notes. Can also create
 *    chain reactions where triggered tokens then trigger others.
 *
 *  1. `!triggerByTag [tag] [radius_ft] [action_macro]`
 *     - `[tag]`: A keyword (e.g., "explosiveBarrel", "magicMine") that must be present
 *       in the GM Notes of nearby tokens (case-insensitive, enclosed in curly braces like `{tag}`).
 *     - `[radius_ft]`: The radius in feet to search for other tokens around the selected token.
 *     - `[action_macro]`: The API command or chat message to execute if matching tokens are found.
 *       - Use the special placeholder `@TOKENID@` to refer to the token that was found by the trigger.
 *       - Example: `!spawnComplexFx FX[burn] ID[@TOKENID@]` will run the burn effect on the found token.
 *
 *  2. Modular Overrides (NEW):
 *     - You can override the `[action_macro]` on a per-token basis by adding `Macro:[MacroName]` to its GM Notes.
 *     - The script processes each line of a found token's GM notes independently.
 *     - Example GM Notes for a token:
 *       `{flammable} Macro:[CustomExplosion]`
 *       `{flammable}`
 *       This will cause the token to both run the `CustomExplosion` macro AND the default `[action_macro]` from the `!triggerByTag` command.
 *
 *  3. How it Works (`TokenFX.trigger.processTrigger`):
 *     - The script gets the selected origin token.
 *     - It calculates the search radius in pixels based on page settings.
 *     - It finds all tokens on the same page within the radius.
 *     - For each found token, it reads its GM Notes and processes each line:
 *       - If a line contains the `{tag}` and a `Macro:[MacroName]` definition, it runs that macro (with the found token as context for placeholders).
 *       - If a line contains just the `{tag}`, it runs the default `[action_macro]` from the `!triggerByTag` command.
 *
 *  4. Chain Reactions (`runChainReaction`):
 *     - After a token is acted upon, the script checks its GM Notes again for a specific chain reaction pattern:
 *       `chain:newTag[maxTriggers][chainRadiusFt]` (e.g., `chain:secondaryExplosion[1][10ft]`)
 *       - `newTag`: The tag to use for the next link in the chain.
 *       - `[maxTriggers]` (optional, default 1): How many times *this specific token* can propagate
 *         this chain link. Prevents infinite loops.
 *       - `[chainRadiusFt]` (optional, default original radius): The radius for this next chain link.
 *     - If a chain pattern is found and the token hasn't exceeded its `maxTriggers`, it constructs and sends a new `!triggerByTagChain` command.
 *
 *  5. `!triggerByTagChain ...`:
 *     - This is an internal command primarily used by the script itself to continue a chain.
 *
 *  6. `!stopChains`:
 *     - Manually stops any ongoing chain reaction sequence.
 *
 *
 * VI. DELAYED COMMAND EXECUTION (`TokenFX.delay`):
 *     Command: `!Delay [seconds] {command_to_run}` or `!delay [seconds] {command_to_run}`
 *
 *  - Purpose: Simple utility to delay the execution of any chat message or API command.
 *  - `[seconds]`: The number of seconds to wait.
 *  - `{command_to_run}`: The full command or message, enclosed in curly braces.
 *  - How it Works:
 *    - Parses the seconds and the command.
 *    - Uses `setTimeout` to schedule the `command_to_run` to be sent to `sendChat`
 *      after the specified delay.
 *
 *
 * VII. UTILITY & LISTING COMMANDS:
 *
 *  1. `!listStandardFx`:
 *     - Whispers to the GM a list of all `FX_TYPES` and `FX_COLORS` defined in
 *       `TokenFX.config`. Useful for knowing available built-in effect options.
 *
 *  2. `!listCustomFx`:
 *     - Whispers to the GM a list of all custom FX that were successfully loaded by the
 *       script on startup. It shows the `name` (used in `FX[name]`) and the Roll20 `ID`
 *       of each custom FX.
 *     - If no custom FX are found, it informs the GM.
 *
 *  3. `!getSelectedIDs`:
 *     - If one or more tokens are selected on the VTT, this command will whisper to the GM
 *       a space-separated list of their token IDs.
 *     - Useful for quickly grabbing IDs to use in other API commands or script parameters.
